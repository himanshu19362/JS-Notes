Function Statement or Function Declaration: This way of creating a function is called function statement.
function a(){

}

Function Expression: Assigning function to a variable is called function expression.
var f = function(){

}

Difference between Function Statement and Function Expression.
=>Function Statement are hoisted whereas function expression are not hoisted.

Anonymous Functions : Used in places where functions are used as values.
For eg: In case of function expression , we are using anonymous functions.
We can also use anonymous functions when we pass it as argument to another function.

Named Function Expression: Function Expression where the anonymous is given some name.
var b = function xyz(){

}

b()	//Works 
xyz()	//xyz function is not defined.

Parameter: The values we pass to function when we define it. 
Argument: The actual value that we pass to function call.

First Class Functions: Ability of a function to be used as value.Functions are also called first class citizens.The reason is same.

CallBack Function: Function that is passed as argument to some function is called callback function.

function attachEventListener(){
	let count = 0
	document.getElementById("id").addEventListener('click' , function xyz(){
		console.log(count)	//Here , xyz is forming closure with count.Closure is used to add privacy to our code.
	})
}
attachEventListener()	


//Higher Order Function
A function that takes function as argument or returns a function are called higher order function.
Functional Programming : Thinking of logic in terms of functions.
