Redux Library: A state management system for cross component or state wide state.
Reducer: A function that returns the new updated state based on a particular action.
action: A JS object that tells the type of action we want to perform on our data.

Reducer Function should be a pure function ie... the function with a particular argument will always return the same value.
The component inside which the store should be accessible should be wrapped with Provider passing the store as prop.

useSelector: Hook that helps in selecting a slice of the state present in store.
useDispatch: Hook that returns us a dispatch function.
payload: Extra information that we send inside our action.

=> Never mutate/alter the previous state.
