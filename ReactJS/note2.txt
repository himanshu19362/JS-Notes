JSX Interpolation: It is basically a way of writing some JS code inside JSX.

Two methods related to props :
1) propTypes : defines the type of data that is being passed through props.

For example:
<Navbar arg1 , arg2 , arg3> 
Navbar.propTypes = {
	arg1: PropTypes.string,
	arg2: PropTypes.string , 
	...
}

2) defaultProps: defines the default values of props just in case we don't send some props.

For example:
Navbar.defaultProps = {
	arg1: "Apple" , 
	arg2: "Heading 1" , 
	...
}

State Hook : It is basically used to define the state variables of a component.
State of a Component : A bunch of values that represent some information about the UI/Component and it may change during the lifecycle of the component. 

Variable declared using the state Hooks are managed by React somewhere in the memory.

When a variable is updated using state Hooks method , it runs the code inside the function again.
Then it will detect changes from the last time and present the changes on the screen.

When we update the value using state hooks , the value in the variable doesn't get updated immidiately.
It gets scheduled for later.

If the new state is dependent on the previous state , then use a anonymous function or make separate state variables.
Eg:setState((prevState) =>{
	return {...prevState , title: event.target.value}
})


event.preventDefault inside onSubmit of form will prevent the page from reloading.

Two way binding: It means that for inputs , we just don't listen to the changes , but we can also pass the new value back to the input and this new value can be of our choice.

Child to Parent Component Communication: Make a function in the Parent Component and pass it into child component as props and run it there. 
Using this method , we would be able to access the state of child in parent component.
